# cancerCellClassification
We use PyTorch to train two deep neural network which can take a 100x100 pixel images with a cell nuclei in the centre of the image and classify it into one of the following types which are shown in the figures above:

Normal epithelial cell nuclei with label 0.
Cancer epithelial cell nuclei with label 1.
Muscle cell nuclei with label 2.
Immune leukocyte cell nuclei with label 3.
